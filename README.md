# 🚗 Evade Bombs - A Simple Pygame Car Game

Evade Bombs is a fun arcade-style car game built with **Pygame**. Navigate your car on a scrolling road while avoiding falling bombs. The game becomes increasingly difficult the longer you survive!


---

## 🎮 Gameplay

- Use **arrow keys** to control the car:
  - `← →` to move left/right
  - `↑ ↓` to move up/down
- **Avoid the bombs** falling from the sky.
- Score increases over time — the longer you survive, the higher your score.
- Press `S` to start the game and `R` to restart after a game over.

## 🧠 Features
